3 ~ When opened, on line 13-18 you will have settings, change these to your preferences

4 ~ Change the file directory to the folder you want it to spam files in (if doesnt exist then it will create folders for it) -- NOTE: If you keep it default or make it something like documents, one drive will cap it and it will not work so use the C:/ directory

5 ~ Save your editted file

6 ~ (OPTIONAL!) Change the .py file to an EXE by running this in your python interpreter terminal ```pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py``` Disclaimer!: Make sure to change "your_script.py" to the name of your python script, or the script's path
```
